# Relay
A Relay is an electromechanical device that can be used to make or break an electrical connection. It consists of a flexible moving mechanical part which can be controlled electronically through an electromagnet
basically, a relay is just like a mechanical switch but you can control it with an electronic signal instead of manually turning it on or off. Again this working principle of relay fits only for the electromechanical relay.
There are many types of relay and each relay has its own application, a standard, and generally used relay is made up of electromagnets which in general used as a switch. The main operation of this device is to make or break contact with the help of a signal without any human involvement in order to switch it ON or OFF. It is mainly used to control a high powered circuit using a low power signal. Generally, a DC signal is used to control the circuit which is driven by high voltage like controlling AC home appliances with DC signals from microcontrollers.
